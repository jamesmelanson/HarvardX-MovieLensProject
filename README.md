## Purpose
Media streaming services, such as Netflix and Spotify, contain a wide variety of media in their libraries. Further,
different users of these services have different preferences in what they view or listen to. These services
recommend videos and create personalized playlists for users. However, how can these recommendations be
produced?

The aim of this project is to produce a machine learning-based model to predict a user’s rating of a movie,
using information from a dataset containing 10 million movie ratings. The accuracy of the model was assessed
by measuring the difference between users’ true ratings, contained in a test set that was held out during the
model’s development, and the model’s predictions of user ratings. Predictions of users’ ratings were able to
be made that were informed by information present within the dataset, allowing for the prediction model’s
use as a movie recommendation system.
